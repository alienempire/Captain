# ELIZA
a rather random chatbot based on ELIZA meant to stimulate creative conceptions
Well I worked with Eliza for a long time. She likes to run on OpenBSD but it 
can be done on really anything that does c code. Its not really meant for kids
but if youure trying to learn to read it might be okay since most of it is from
stuff that isnt really too rude to play.
